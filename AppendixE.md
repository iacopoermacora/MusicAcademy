# **Appendix E. Hints examples**

**Question Q1:**  
What is the duration of a quarter note in 4/4 time?  
Hint 1 (Minimal Help): Think about how many beats are in a measure of 4/4 time. How might a quarter note fit into that?  
Hint 2 (Moderate Help): In 4/4 time, a full measure has 4 beats. How many quarter notes do you think would fit in one measure?  
Hint 3 (Full Help): A quarter note lasts for 1 beat in 4/4 time. It takes 4 quarter notes to fill a measure.  

**Question Q2:**  
What is the difference between a natural note and a sharp note?  
Hint 1 (Minimal Help): Consider what happens to a note's pitch when a sharp is applied.  
Hint 2 (Moderate Help): A sharp raises the pitch of a note by a small interval. What interval do you think this is?  
Hint 3 (Full Help): A sharp raises a note by one semitone, while a natural note has no alterations. For example, F sharp (Fâ™¯) is one semitone higher than F natural.
